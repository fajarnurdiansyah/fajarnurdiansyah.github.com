Model Mayhem Labuan Lalang

Another black and white image for my blog new theme. This one was taken with
my new AF Nikkor 50mm f/1.8D lens. I love the lens. Its sharp, fast, and very
light. The only drawback is it won't autofocus on my camera body.

  
My Nikon D5000 doesn't have the built in motor required to turn the focusing
screw in this lens. So all my picture with this lens is manually focused. Its
not that hard though, theres a built in electronic rangefinder that help you
focus. The focus ring also rotate much more longer than my AF-S lenses so
getting a precise focus in manual mode is much more easier.

  
Oh, the portrait model? He was the parking officer in Labuan Lalang, the port
to Menjangan. I had a light chat with him while waiting for my friends to sort
out out transport.
