A typical paddy field in Pupuan, Blimbing. In Bali, paddy field 
use a unique irigation system for terasering called [Subak]:
> Subak is the name of water management (irrigation) system for paddy fields 
> on Bali island. For Balinese, irrigation is not simply providing water for 
> the plant's roots, but water is used to construct a complex, pulsed 
> artificial ecosystem. Paddy fields in Bali were built around water 
> temples and the allocation of water is made by a priest.

Subak is more than just a way to get water to the rice in the field. It is a ritualized system and has been preserved from the late eight century.
