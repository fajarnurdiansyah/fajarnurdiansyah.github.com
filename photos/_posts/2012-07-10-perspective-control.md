Wesley Church in Freemantle, Perth . May 2011
{: .caption}

This is the same photo that I have [previously posted](/photos/wesley-church-freemantle/) here, but this time I learned how to correct perspective in Photoshop. I like that the building doesn't looks like it's about to fall over.

I might do another repost of this photo when I learned how to correct the flares. It is distracting.
