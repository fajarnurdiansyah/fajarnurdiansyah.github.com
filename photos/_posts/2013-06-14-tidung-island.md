One fine morning in Tidung Island
{: .caption}
 
Located 20 Kilometers of the coast of Jakarta, Tidung offers a clean beach with unspoiled nature just a few minutes away from the metropolitan city. 

It literaly is a breath of fresh air, especially if you arrive after departing from [Muara Angke][1].
