Grass Bokeh Sunset or is it Sunset Bokeh Grass?
{: .caption}

This picture was taken with Jpeg Basic Small setting on my camera - the lowest
quality setting. I was playing with time-lapse feature the other day and
forgot to set it back. When I realize it was on the wrong setting, the sun had
already set.

  
Ken Rockwell the [Jpeg shooter][8] will no doubt tell you that it doesn't
matter what the [quality setting][9] are. But when you only gonna be there
once, you'd want the best quality you can get right?

  
**Moral of the story**: "Alway remember that you are forgetful"
