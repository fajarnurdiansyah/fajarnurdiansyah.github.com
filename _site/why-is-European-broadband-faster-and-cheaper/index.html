		<p>A nice article from engadget about <a href='http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/28/why-is-european-broadband-faster-and-cheaper-blame-the-governme/'>why is European broadband faster and cheaper</a> (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not government spending. The UK&#8217;s administration hasn&#8217;t invested a penny in broadband infrastructure, and most of the network in the Netherlands has been built with private capital. (The city government in Amsterdam took a minority stake in the fiber network there, but that&#8217;s an investment that will pay dividends if the network is profitable &#8211; and the private investors who own the majority share of the system plan to make sure that it will be.)</p>

<p>The game-changer in these two European countries has been government regulators who have <strong>forced more competition</strong> in the market for broadband.</p>

<p>I think our goverment have one a great job pushing the price of mobile call/text down. Time to do the same thing to internet connection.</p>
