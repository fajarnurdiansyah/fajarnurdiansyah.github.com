Buku Ini Aku Pinjam

Nothing interesting lately, so I just took pictures of the mundane stuff in my
room.

  
The book is "A Short History of Nearly Everything" by Bill Bryson. Its a
science book - winner of the Aventis prize for science books 2004 - but Bill
manage to write it with a witty and engaging style that your curiosity will
force you to keep on reading, at least until you finished the chapter you're
on.
