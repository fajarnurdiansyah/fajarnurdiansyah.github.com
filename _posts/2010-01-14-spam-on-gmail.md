title: Spam on Gmail

This whole time, I've been very careful with my email. I never gave it out
easily, never register to any shady website, never displayed it in public
space, I never risk my email. Why? Because I love my current email. This is my
professional looking personal email. You know, the one using the
firstname.lastname@domain.com format. It's not those embarrassing old email
addresses like cute_babe@yahoo.com or neo_cool@hotmail.com kind of email
(which looks cool back in 2000, the 'matrix' age). I love this email address
and I don't want it to be ruined by the spam, so I take precaution when giving
it out.
  
Do you know that Gmail have this nice feature where you can have unlimited
aliases for your email [address][6]?

I've been using this trick for awhile now. For example, when I register on
vimeo, I use address+vimeo@gmail.com. At wordpress I use
myemailaddress+wordpress@gmail.com. Its bit tiring, especially when I forgot
the password for those site, I have to guess what plus word did I use when
registering. Its usually the domain name, but sometimes its not.

This morning I found out that my precaution is paying off. I got this email
from josnke@rosyvalley.com claiming to be from the best drug store in Canada.
Off course gmail spam filter correctly identified it as a SPAM, but still, its
very annoying. I always check my emails first thing in the morning, and spam
email is not fun (I check my emails every morning while having breakfast,
reading about a d\*ck enlarger drugs really kills my appetite). Now I have to
waste more time checking the SPAM folder for any false positive. Because even
gmail spam filter is not perfect.

  
I was ready to say goodbye to my spam free inbox until I checked the email details.
Turns out it was send to myaddress+seesmic@gmail.com. Wow! I never thought
seesmic would stoop so low as to sell my contact information to spammer. A
quick googling reveal that they're [not that low][7]:

Hm.. Okay. Seesmic is not guilty. What about my email? Well, simple. I just
create a new filter with this rule:

> If sent to myaddress+seesmic@gmail.com move to trash

There. Done.
