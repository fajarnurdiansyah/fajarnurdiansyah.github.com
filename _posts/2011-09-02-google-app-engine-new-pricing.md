The new pricing model for Google App Engine will kill my little toy: [flick]. My app is going from $0 to a projected $2.5/day, [^projected] or about $75 permonth; Which is very expensive considering I'm not making any money on it. Almost all this increase is due to frontend instance hours -- my app is IO bound as it rely on the Flickr API. 

This is too bad. The generous quotas made using the proprietary APIs worth it. Now it's just another PaaS.

When this pricing goes live, I will have to take the service down. This is certainly not a great experience for a developer who wan't to commit their core business in google development stack.

[^projected]: Kudos to google for providing a billing projection tools.
