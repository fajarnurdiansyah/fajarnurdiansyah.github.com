With the price of HDTV keeps going down, it's only a matter of time 
before people start using it for PC monitor. Its big, its cheap, 
and have quite a decent image quality.

## The Pros {#pros}

Price per Inch. Pricewise, HDTV is dirt cheap. For a standard PC monitor, 
you will usually pay about x$ per inch. An HDTV can goes as low as $y per 
inch. This will be a considerable saving if you are living in a third world 
country and barely have enough money to spend on tech toys.

The only downside of an HDTV is its low resolution. A standard PC monitor 
has a PPI (Pixel per Inch) count of over 80. A standard 32" HDTV with 
FullHD resolution (1920x1080)

## The Cons {#cons}
While the average PC monitor will have a few hundreds of pixel per inch 
-- PPI -- an HDTV will have much less of pixels. This will affect you 
if you use your monitor for text related activity. Writing, coding, 
web reading, all this will feel slightly less confortable on an HDTV. 
The text will look not as sharp. some shape will looks funny. You'll 
definately won't have an Apple Cinema TV class experience. Of course you 
didn't pay as much.

The standard conception is that you will feel confortable reading text 
in a monitor if its resolution is at minimum 76PPI. A standard that an 
HDTV clearly doesn't reach. But with a good font smoothing algorithm, 
this is not that much of a problem.
