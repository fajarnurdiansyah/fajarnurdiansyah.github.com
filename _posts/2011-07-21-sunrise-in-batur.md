The hunt for sunrise. Mount Batur summit, 2011.

You will be forgiven if you think that sunrise is nothing special. Afterall you can see them everywhere, everyday --- unless you live in Greenland. It all just seems soâ€¦normal. 

Last week I went hiking to mount Batur and the sunrise was anything but normal. The way the sun peeks behind the clouds, with shining golden light clearing the mist down in the valley of kintamani, made me realize: sunrise is beautiful. Or is it Batur's sunrise?

This picture was taken last week with my friends from Mitrais photography club (MTPC), after 3 hours hiking.
