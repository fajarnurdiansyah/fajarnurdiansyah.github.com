Rapid Release will get them the same treatment some time in the future" .cendter .corps}

Notice how the Chrome browser just say _Yes_ on the browser support, 
without any version number? That is the result of their break neck release pace.The users don't talk about version number anymore. It's irrelevant. And that is the direction Firefox is taking with their [every six weeks] Rapid Release.
