intro: Unlimited private Git repos!
---

Git users now have a choice of using Github for public projects (a la Twitter) 
and Bitbucket for private projects (Google Plus). I think that is how most 
people are going to use it.

> A big advantage for Bitbucket users is the ability to have **unlimited private 
> repositories for free**. This means you can **store every line of code you've 
> ever written in one place without paying a cent**.
