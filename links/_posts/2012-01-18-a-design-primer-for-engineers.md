Rands[^Rands] on design:

> But you keep hearing this word. More importantly, you hear the urgency behind the word. You hear that choosing to design a thing is an important thing to do and the person saying it is also important, so you nod vigorously while silently thinking, "I have no fucking idea what you're talking about and I'm pretty sure neither do you."


[^Rands]: Not his real name actually. The real name is Michael Lopp.
