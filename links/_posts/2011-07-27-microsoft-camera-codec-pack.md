If you want to see the thumbnail of the RAW (NEF, CR2) files from your DSLR 
[^standardviewer], the only choice was to install FastPictureViewer codec. 

They [discontinued][] the free version of their RAW images codec but don't 
worry, Microsoft step up to the plate and released their own [codec pack][].
It support a whole bunch of cameras, unfortunately still no support for camera 
using the latest sony sensor: Sony a55, Nikon D7000, Pentax K-5.

[codec pack]: http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=26829

[^standardviewer]: Or open the file using any standard image viewer.
