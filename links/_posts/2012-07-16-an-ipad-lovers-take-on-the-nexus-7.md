MG Siegler over at his apple[^apple] column at Techcrunch:

> Again, the fact remains that the Nexus 7 is a great device. Not a great device graded on some weird curve where we pretend that Apple products don't exist --- but a great device, period. The $199 price point is just icing on the cake.

You have to give credit to Siegler for posting a fair review for an Apple competitor product. And all this talk about Jelly Bean being almost as smooth as iOS make me want to grab one myself.

[^apple]: Seriously though, the post has an apple tag.
