intro: How not to unlisten your users

Joss Crowcroft on the noreply mailbox practice:

> Hey asshole, what if I want to reply? It astounds me that in 2011, startups
> and companies are sending out automated emails with noreply email addresses. 
> It basically says to the recipient:
>
>  *"I'm not interested in hearing from you by email, regardless of whether 
> email is better or easier for you. I just don't respect you enough to take 
> the risk that a dozen people might reply and insult me."* \[...\]
>
> So I've given you my email address. I've given you the permission to contact 
> me directly, via the medium I check more than anything (nasty habit, I know.) 
> And this is how you repay me?

Maybe this make sense for big company like google. Their employee to user ratio 
just doesn't scale. But I don't understand why would a start up eliminate the 
chance to listen to their users.
