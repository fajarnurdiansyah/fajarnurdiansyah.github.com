Mike Johnston on photo caption:
> Captions are how photographers become more than camera operators, how we are honest or deceptive, how we become thoughtful. If you've not been in the habit of captioning your pictures (or giving them descriptive titles), take a few minutes sometime and jot down the "stories" behind a handful of your own pictures. It might be an instructive exercise.

Captioning is the hardest part in my photo workflow.
