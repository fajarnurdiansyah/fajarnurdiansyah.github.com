A nice article from engadget about [why is European broadband faster and cheaper]  (emphasis mine):

> Not government spending. The UK's administration hasn't invested a penny in broadband infrastructure, and most of the network in the Netherlands has been built with private capital. (The city government in Amsterdam took a minority stake in the fiber network there, but that's an investment that will pay dividends if the network is profitable -- and the private investors who own the majority share of the system plan to make sure that it will be.)
> 
> The game-changer in these two European countries has been government regulators who have **forced more competition** in the market for broadband.

I think our goverment have one a great job pushing the price of mobile call/text down. Time to do the same thing to internet connection.
