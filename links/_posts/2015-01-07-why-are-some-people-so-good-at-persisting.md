intro: About perseverance
---
Very nice story:

> But in 1958, at the age of 48, this entrepreneur finally hit on an idea that eventually became a company worth 700 billion dollars on the Tokyo stock exchange.
> 
> Momofuku Ando invented instant ramen noodles. Ando's story is an inspiring tale of perseverance. And yet, I know most people reading this discount the tale: Ando possesses a willpower most of us will never have. We might be a little inspired by Ando, but we can't possibly imitate his perseverance.
> 
> But, I don't think that's true. Ando's story goes much deeper than that.
