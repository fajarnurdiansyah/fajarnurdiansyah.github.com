# About

Hello, my name is Fajar Nurdiansyah. 

I'm a programmer, hobbyst photographer, open water diver, and a fast-food eater.

I live in a [midsized city] in Indonesia, and I write software for [Mitrais]. 
I doubt you'll ever see my work because most of them are internal corporate 
software. But I really like writing code, so I create stuff on the weekend. 
Stuff like [flick].

If you want to contact me, email [fajar@fajarnurdiansyah.com]

You can also find me on [twitter], [flickr], and [facebook].

## About this blog

I can't write.[^code] This blog is an attempt to fix that.

The blog is a static html website powered by [jekyll], a simple, blog aware, 
static site generator.[^jekyll] Modeled after tumblr, it has [Link], [Quote], 
and [Photo] post. I dont see how I will use Chat and Audio post. 

Hosting is provided by the awesome [GitHub], you can view the full [source 
code for this blog here].
